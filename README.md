# V2_Pop_Data_Extractor
This is a very simple tool that takes Victoria 2 savegames and extracts into an xlsx file the pop data that they contain.

To extract the pop data initiate the following steps:
1. Download the EXE file
2. Run the EXE file
3. A window will open that will prompt you to select a file with the extension .v2
4. Another window will open that will prompt you to select the location where you would want the xlsx file to be generated
5. An xlsx file should appear in the location you have selected

ABOUT:
This is an open project where anyone is welcome to contribute. From a programming POW, I mainly wanted to test / learn two things with this project, these being how to convert a python .py file into an .exe file that anyone could use and secondly, how to operate a public github repo. From a V2 POW I always wanted to be able to compare the population change over time within a province, which is not possible ingame.
